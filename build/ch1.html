<p>Formal venues aren't the only way to share research with the world. Online repositories such as Cambridge University's <a href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>
provide a space for authors to publish their works without peer review. This has several <a href="https://www.aje.com/arc/benefits-of-preprints-for-researchers/">key benefits</a>. If your research idea is incredibly novel in a competitive field, publishing fast and early creates a record of priority, attributing the discovery to you. For example, famed mathematician <a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems-poincar%C3%A9-conjecture/perelmans-solution">Grigoriy Perelman's</a> solution to the Poincare Conjecture was first published to the arXiv. Though it is not guaranteed, open-access archives may also allow for peer review at a broader scale, given that articles are available for anyone with an internet connect, and not hidden behind the paywalls common to major academic journals.</p>
