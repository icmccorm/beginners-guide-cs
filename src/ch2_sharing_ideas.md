## Whitepapers: Why Wait?

Formal venues aren't the only way to share research with the world. Online repositories such as Cambridge University's [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) 
provide a space for authors to publish their works without peer review. This has several [key benefits](https://www.aje.com/arc/benefits-of-preprints-for-researchers/). If your research idea is incredibly novel in a competitive field, publishing fast and early creates a record of priority, attributing the discovery to you. For example, famed mathematician [Grigoriy Perelman's](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems-poincar√©-conjecture/perelmans-solution) solution to the Poincare Conjecture was first published to the arXiv. Though it is not guaranteed, open-access archives may also allow for peer review at a broader scale, given that articles are available for anyone with an internet connect, and not hidden behind the paywalls common to major academic journals.
